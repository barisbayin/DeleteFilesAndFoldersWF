I have developed a Windows Form application that allows users to search for and delete files based on specific keywords in the file names. The application allows the user to select a folder, and it will search through all subfolders and files within that folder for file names that contain the specified keywords. Once the files are found, they are deleted from the system.

This application can be useful for cleaning up large amounts of files and removing unnecessary files from your computer. It's also useful for those who want to automate the process of deleting files with specific keywords in the name. The application is user-friendly and easy to use, with a simple interface that allows users to select the folder and input the keywords they want to search for.

One of the key features of this application is its ability to search through subfolders, which means that it can scan an entire directory tree and delete all the files that match the specified criteria. Additionally, the application allows users to specify multiple keywords, so they can perform more complex searches and delete multiple types of files in one go.

Overall, this application is a great tool for anyone looking to quickly and easily delete large numbers of files based on specific keywords in the file names.
